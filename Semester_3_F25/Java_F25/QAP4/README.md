## Post-Assignment Questions

1.  How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please estimate per problem if possible) 

    About 4-5 hours in total.

2.  What online resources did you use? (e.g., Lectures, YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc.)

    Only a few refreshers here and there with online documentation and a bit of youtube. Used AI for my pom.xml because I couldnt figure out why it was not compiling.


3.  Did you get help from any classmates? (If yes, provide names; they must be enrolled in your class)

    No, this was completed individually.


4.  Did you ask for help from an instructor? (Mention the number of questions/help sessions) 

    No, I did not.


5.  Rate the difficulty of each problem and your confidence in solving similar problems in the future.

    4/10, intructions very explicit, did not feel it was asking too much of my current abilities. Enhanced my confidence for future projects.
