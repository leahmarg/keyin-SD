## Post-Assignment Questions

1.  How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please estimate per problem if possible) 

    About 5-6 hours in total.

2.  What online resources did you use? (e.g., Lectures, YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc.)

    I rely heavily on YouTube and Stack Overflow and previous similar work/examples. I try my best to reserve AI for when I run into bugs I can't sort out or just adding proper documentation/notes in the code. I use Prettier formatter to make my code pretty as well.


3.  Did you get help from any classmates? (If yes, provide names; they must be enrolled in your class)

    No, this was completed individually.


4.  Did you ask for help from an instructor? (Mention the number of questions/help sessions) 

    No, I did not.


5.  Rate the difficulty of each problem and your confidence in solving similar problems in the future.

    Maybe a 4.5/10, questions are very straightforward and achievable. This heightened my confidence in my ability for future Java programming.
