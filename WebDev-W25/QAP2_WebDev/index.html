            <h3>In the beginning ...</h3>
            <p>
              The history of computers starts out about 2000 years ago, with the
              birth of the abacus. When the beads on the abacus are moved
              around, according to programming rules memorized by the user, all
              regular arithmetic problems can be done. In 1671, Gottfried
              Wilhelm von Leibniz invented a computer that was built in 1694. It
              could add, and, after changing some things around, multiply. About
              a century later <div class="the-first">Thomas of Colmar created the first successful
              mechanical calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, and
              divide.</div>

            <ul>
              <li>
                In 1812, Babbage realized that many long calculations were
                really a series of predictable actions that were constantly
                repeated. He began to design an automatic mechanical calculating
                machine, which he called a difference engine.
              </li>
              <li>
                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/Herman-Hollerith">Herman Hollerith</a> and James Powers made a step towards automated
                computing with the development of punched cards. Reading errors
                were reduced dramatically, workflow increased, and stacks of
                punched cards could be used as memory of almost unlimited size.
                For more than 50 years, punched card machines did most of the
                world's first business computing.
              </li>
              <li>
                The start of <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii">World War II</a> produced a large need for computer
                capacity. In 1942, John P. Eckert and John W. Mauchly decided to
                build a high - speed electronic computer to do the job. Known as
                ENIAC, this machine could multiply two numbers at a rate of 300
                per second.
              </li>
              <li>
                Early in the 50's two important engineering discoveries changed
                the image of the computer field - Magnetic Core Memory and
                Transistor - <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/circuit-elements/">Circuit Elements</a>. These technical discoveries
                quickly found their way into computers. Such computers were
                mostly found in large computer centers operated by industry,
                government, and private laboratories.

                In the 1960's, efforts to design and develop the fastest
                possible computer with the greatest capacity reached a turning
                point with the Stretch computer by IBM. Stretch was made with
                the fastest access time, and total capacity in the vicinity of
                100,000,000 words.

              <li>
                Many companies, some new to the computer field, introduced
                programmable minicomputers supplied with software packages in
                the 1970’s. The "shrinking" trend continued with the
                introduction of personal computers (PC's), which are
                programmable machines small enough and inexpensive enough to be
                purchased and used by individuals. Many companies, such as Apple
                Computer and Radio Shack introduced very successful PCs in the
                1970’s.
              </li>
              <li>
                By the late 1980’s, some personal computers were run by
                microprocessors that, handling 32 bits of data at a time, could
                process about 4,000,000 instructions per second.

                Computer networking, e-mail and the Internet, and electronic
                publishing are just a few of the applications that have grown in
                recent years. Computers continue to decrease in price, offering
                the promise that soon, “computers will reside in most homes,
                offices, and schools”.

                As computers continued to advance through the 1980s and 1990s,
                they then became significantly more efficient and better yet,
                they were more <b>affordable</b>. This new factor sparked the
                integration of the computer into the home. Up until this point
                computers were far too expensive to have, and were usually
                produced in small numbers. As the want for home computers grew,
                brands took this in stride by competing to create machines with
                the best capabilities and a small(er) price tag. Some of these
                brands remain the <div class="most-pop">most popular</div> computer manufacturers in
                history.
