1. How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track 
of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best 
you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

Answer: I would estimate around 8, I worked on it little by little, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly.

2. What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

Answer: I consulted my usual, stack overflow, some youtube videos, and a tiny touch of chat gpt because my test harnesses kept breaking.

3. Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name 
of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

Answer: I did not consult any of my classmates no.

4. Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you 
ask (or how many help sessions did you require)? 

Answer: I did not require any questions or help sessions.

5. Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether 
you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the 
same techniques in the future now that you’ve completed this one. 

Answer: Maybe a 5.5/10? The only thing I really struggled with was the test harness and gettinga solution that worked for all the DOM testers. I feel confident I could tackle a similar question.
